\section{How to Chaos meeting}
\textbf{Ansvarlig:}\DAGS + \ALLV + \KABS\\

Chaos meetings are held two-three times daily: Once in the morning, once after lunch break and potentially one in the evening - the times are in the detailed time plans but may also be started spontaneously by \DAGS. Make sure to have a bum at the chaos meeting. The morning meeting happens before the russes are woken up (aka it's top secret). 

A chaos meeting should take at most 15 minutes! General points to be discussed at a chaos meeting:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Bum update
    \item What has happened? Did everything go as it should?
    \begin{itemize}
        \item How was the time plan?
        \item Is there anything that is broken?
        \item Any russes who needs extra attention?
        \item Walkthrough of the program for today
    \end{itemize}
    \item Anyone who deserved a badge?
    \item Any other business
    \item Sorry round
    \item Group hug
\end{itemize}
