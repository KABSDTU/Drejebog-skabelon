\textbf{You should refrain from reading further}. This playbook contains \textbf{every} last detail of this trip and the awesome activities we have planed for your sake.

By reading this playbook you would ruin the supprise of the trip. Please return the playbook to the actual owner of it. You will get a beverage of your own choice as a reward.
